I was on [hacker hotshots](http://www.concise-courses.com/infosec/gitdigger-creating-useful-wordlists-from-github/) today. I was asked: Will any of the code make it into Kali?. It didn't even occur to me that some of the code I'm using would be useful to others. After a few moments of thought 'gitrecon' was born.

This tool assumes you have git installed and in your path. I've tested this on Linux and that's about it.

It will allow you to specify a Github username and the number of threads to use. Then it will download/clone all of their repositories.

**UPDATE**

This tool will now spit out a dirs.txt and files.txt for easy burp scanning.
