It's with great regret that I need to shutdown the hardware and say goodbye to my gitdigger project. There are a few reasons and I will try and address them in this post.  

<!--more-->

**Bandwidth**

Where I am located my only option is DSL (and yes, I know how much this service sucks).  After two years the family is a bit tired of the slow internet and the crappy looking netflix since I am hogging all the bandwidth.  My only option is to purchase a second business account (either cable or dsl) which are both pretty pricey.

**Time**

There are so many changes I'd like to make to the code base to make it better and faster, but I just don't have the time to do so.  At this point any change requires a good bit of thought on how to make that change over the existing dataset, which is huge. I also don't have time to write the code to pull out all the expliots and interesting things I find as I get more and more into my new job.

**Cost**

To truely take this project to the next step its going to involve funding for bandwidth, hosting, and data analitics.  Without funding I'll only ever be able to look at a small (and outdated) part of the picture.

**Desire**

I think its time for something else, perhaps something with a bit more of a challenge.  Not much more I can say about this, but I'm sure many of you will understand what I mean.

I want to thank everyone who has helped support this project over the last few years  I've had a great time doing talks about it and the many things that the data can be used for (both good and bad). 

Thank you,

Jaime
