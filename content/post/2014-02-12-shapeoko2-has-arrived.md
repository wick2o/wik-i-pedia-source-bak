Today I completed my [Shapeoko 2](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/desktop-cnc-mill-kit-shapeoko-2) build.  Following the instuctions on their wiki was pretty straight forward.  There are a few key items I will share in case you order one yourself.

<!--more-->

 * Order the arduino mount and fan. It's an extra $50 but very worth it.
 * The brass parts require 3 washers and are VERY easy to bottom out and break. Not so easy to get replacements.
 * Order the upgraded base plate.  It has threaded holes for easily holding down your material.  I have not done this yet, but it may be my next upgrade.

Now the fun can begin as I come up with ideas to make/mill.
