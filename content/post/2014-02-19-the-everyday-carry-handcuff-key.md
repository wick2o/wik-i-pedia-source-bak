This is a very small inconspicuous handcuff key I found in one of my RSS feeds.  I'm not sure why, but I had to check them out.  I like the small footprint and it clips nicely on a belt loop or on the webbing of my daily carry bag.  I don't like that it's made of stainless steel; it's something that you could easily forget about while going through a metal detector.
