**The Good**:

The Red Team Field Manual (RTFM) is a no fluff, but thorough reference guide for serious Red Team members who routinely find themselves on a mission without Google or the time to scan through a man page. The RTFM contains the basic syntax for commonly used Linux and Windows command line tools, but it also encapsulates unique use cases for powerful tools such as Python and Windows PowerShell. The RTFM will repeatedly save you time looking up the hard to remember Windows nuances such as Windows wmic and dsquery command line tools, key registry values, scheduled tasks syntax, startup locations and Windows scripting.

**The Bad**:

This is not a book you purchase to sit down and read from front to back. It's more of a desk reference for when you get stuck and have no access to google.  It is a peek inside of mine of a red teamer and his notes and it shows in the layout of the book.

**Summary**:

I would recommend this book for those just starting out or looking for other methods for how to do things.  I personally found some good tips and tricks that I didn't know and made the book totally worth the purchase.

ENJOY!
