**The Good**:

The Hacker Playbook is filled with tips and tricks from setting up your pentesting rig to virus scanner evasion. This book covers a wide range of tools (almost all open source) with a very nice section of resources for keeping up to date with the lastest security news.

**The Bad**:

I'm not much of a sports fan, and the chapters are broken up into football terms.

**Summary**:

This is a book that everyone should have in his or her collection. It's laid out well and even thought its meant to be read from start to finish, it makes for a great reference book.

ENJOY!
