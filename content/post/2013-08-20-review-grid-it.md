This is the perfect item for your redteamer (or toy) bag. All the little gadgets that normally just flop around on the bottom of my bag are now neatly in one place, and I can find them in a hurry.

In the picture I have the following items:

 - 1gb usb key (with drivers)
 - kit for making an under the door level opener
 - micro 4x microscope with light
 - extra nic (ya never know)
 - some gaffers tape
 - nice non-magnetic pick
 - usb bore-scope
 - id laynard
 - ra ndom id cards

I'm sure ill find some other gadgets in my bag to add to it, but this will have to do for now.
