Tonight I was asked why someones iPhone 5 (or maybe it was a 5s) didn't show up in iTunes. Luckly they had their laptop with them. The OS was Windows 8 so your milage may vary.

**The Solution**

Open Control Panel, then click on Hardware and Sound and then look for Apple iPhone. Right-click on it, choose Properties and then click the Hardware tab. Clickon Properties and then the Change settings button.

Click on the Driver tab and Update Driver, then Browse my computer for driver software.

Now browse to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers and click Ok, then Next. You'll either see a message saying that the best driver is already installed, or a new driver will be installed. If the latter, your iPhone should now show up in iTunes.
