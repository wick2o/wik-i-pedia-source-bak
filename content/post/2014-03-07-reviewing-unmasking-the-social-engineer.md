Unmasking the Social Engineer was written by Christopher Hadnagy at [social-engineer.com](http://social-engineer.com/).  He takes the research from Paul Ekman, PH.D. and applies it to the human element of security. You can find it on Amazon in both Kindle and Paperback versions [HERE](www.amazon.com/dp/1118608577).

**The Good**:

The book covers a wide array of topics including nonverbal communications, decoding body language, deciphering the science behind it all and then how to put it all together.  Hadnagy seems to have taken the extra efforts to make sure that everything in the book is grounded in hard science (and it shows). Each chapter is sprinkled with real life examples of the topics with what worked and what failed on that engagement. The information is not just about body language and how to decode it; it is applied directly to the art of social engineering! 

**The Bad**:

I have read most of the books that were referenced in this book, which made some of the underlining science a bit boring and mostly review.  This isn't really bad; perhaps more of a heads up than anything else.

**Summary**:

This book is written in such a way that it's an easy read from end to end as well as a great reference book on the subject. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in social engineering. This is a must read for anyone starting out to the seasoned pros.

ENJOY!
