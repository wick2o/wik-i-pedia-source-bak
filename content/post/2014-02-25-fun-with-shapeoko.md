I've been looking for a micro project to get some use out of my Shapeoko.  What's more fun then a 5.25 floppy disk coaster?

I started by taking measurements from a real 5.25 disk (yes, I have some sitting around). Next, I modeled it with FreeCAD and then imported it into HeeksCAD.  After about 45 minutes of messing with sketches, pockets, and profiles I had my G-code. 30 minutes later I had a nice coaster for my drinks.
