This year the wife and I stayed at a Haunted B&B and did 2 ghost hunts. We've never done either before and it sounded like. The "hunts" were fun, walking around a haunted location with some other people and using the equipment then you see on all the ghost shows. I bought a small voice recorder while out and about to leave running in the room while we slept.

Here are some sounds I caught in the night in the mist of my snores. One sounds like its saying my name "Jaime", one sounds like a weird moan, and I can't make out the third one.

Warning: You may have to turn your volumne really high to hear them. I did not edited the audio other then to pull them out of a 4 hr recording.
